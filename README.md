# Ph.D second year report

This report contains my report about my research works done in my second year of PhD.

It mainly consists in:
- Research roadmap for Aggregate Computing with ML
- Reinforcement Learning applied at the language-level: learn aggregate computing blocks via program sketching
- Reinforcement Learning applied at the middleware-level: learn to reduce power consuption through local RL processes
- Swarm-Clustering & engineering methodologies for collective applications
