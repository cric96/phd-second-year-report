  abstract  = {Research and technology developments on autonomous agents and autonomic computing promote a vision of artificial systems that are able to resiliently manage themselves and autonomously deal with issues at runtime in dynamic environments. Indeed, autonomy can be leveraged to unburden humans from mundane tasks (cf. driving and autonomous vehicles), from the risk of operating in unknown or perilous environments (cf. rescue scenarios), or to support timely decision-making in complex settings (cf. data-centre operations). Beyond the results that individual autonomous agents can carry out, a further opportunity lies in the collaboration of multiple agents or robots. Emerging macro-paradigms provide an approach to programming whole collectives towards global goals. Aggregate computing is one such paradigm, formally grounded in a calculus of computational fields enabling functional composition of collective behaviours that could be proved, under certain technical conditions, to be self-stabilising. In this work, we address the concept of collective autonomy, i.e., the form of autonomy that applies at the level of a group of individuals. As a contribution, we define an agent control architecture for aggregate multi-agent systems, discuss how the aggregate computing framework relates to both individual and collective autonomy, and show how it can be used to program collective autonomous behaviour. We exemplify the concepts through a simulated case study, and outline a research roadmap towards reliable aggregate autonomy.}

Aggregate Computing has been applied in different scenarios,

One problem of interest in large swarms featuring a variety of sub-goals is swarm clustering, where the individuals of a swarm are assigned or choose to belong to zero or more groups, also called clusters. In this work, we address the sensing-based swarm clustering problem, where clusters are defined based on both the values sensed from the environment and the spatial distribution of the values and the agents. Moreover, we address it in a setting characterised by decentralisation of computation and interaction, and dynamicity of values and mobility of agents. For the solution, we propose to use the field-based computing paradigm, where computation and interaction are expressed in terms of a functional manipulation of fields, distributed and evolving data structures mapping each individual of the system to values over time. We devise a solution to sensing-based swarm clustering leveraging multiple concurrent field computations with limited domain and evaluate the approach experimentally by means of simulations, showing that the programmed swarms form clusters that well reflect the underlying environmental phenomena dynami}

gramming collective intelligence and self-organisation in dis-
tributed systems. In this paradigm, a single “aggregate program”
drives the collective behaviour of the system, provided that the
agents follow an execution protocol consisting of asynchronous
sense-compute-act rounds. For actual execution, a proper aggre-
gate computing middleware or platform has to be deployed across
the nodes of the target distributed system, to support the services
needed for the execution of applications. Overall, the engineering
of aggregate computing applications is a rich activity that spans
multiple concerns including designing the aggregate program,
developing reusable algorithms, detailing the execution model,
and choosing a deployment based on available infrastructure.
Traditionally, these activities have been carried out through ad-
hoc designs and implementations tailored to specific contexts and
goals. To overcome the complexity and cost of manually tailoring
or fixing algorithms, execution details, and deployments, we pro-
pose to use machine learning techniques, to automatically create
policies for applications and their management. To support such
a goal, we detail a rich research roadmap, showing opportunities

  abstract = {The Internet of Things and edge computing are fostering a future of ecosystems
hosting complex decentralized computations, deeply integrated with our very dynamic

next-generation “hardware and platform”, counting myriads of interconnected devices, on top of
which intrinsically-distributed computational processes will run and self-organize. They will
spontaneously spawn, diffuse to pertinent logical/physical regions, cooperate and compete,
opportunistically summon required resources, collect and analyze data, compute results, trigger
distributed actions, and eventually decay.
How would a programming model for such ecosystems look like? Based on research findings on
self-adaptive/self-organizing systems, this paper proposes design abstractions based on
“dynamic decentralization domains”: regions of space opportunistically formed to support
situated recognition and action. We embody the approach into a Scala application program
interface (API) enacting distributed execution and show its applicability in a case study of

there exists a large amount of flexibility in how aggregate systems
could actually execute while preserving the desired functionality.
The ideal place for making choices about execution is the
aggregate computing platform (or middleware), which can be
engineered with the goal of promoting efficiency and other non-
functional goals. In this work, we explore the possibility of
applying Reinforcement Learning at the platform level in order
to optimise aspects of a collective computation while achieving
coherent functional goals. This idea is substantiated through
synthetic experiments of data propagation and collection, where
we show how Q-Learning could reduce the power consumption

Engineering global behaviour out of local activity and interaction, however, is a difficult task, typically addressed by try-and-error approaches in simulation environments. In the context of Aggregate Computing (AC), a prominent functional programming approach for CASs based on field-based coordination, this difficulty is reflected in the design of versatile algorithms preserving efficiency in a variety of environments. To deal with this complexity, in this work we propose to apply Machine Learning techniques to automatically devise local actions to improve over manually-defined AC algorithms specifications. Most specifically, we adopt a Reinforcement Learning-based approach to let a collective learn local policies to improve over the standard gradient algorithm—a cornerstone brick of several higher-level self-organisation algorithms. Our evaluation shows that the learned policies can speed up the self-stabilisation of the gradient to external perturbations.},
