\section{Background}
% \rev{
% 	My research topic concerns engineering large-scale multi-agent 
% 	systems by improving current state-of-the-art algorithms, 
% 	injecting machine learning to improve adaptivity, 
% 	and advancing current distributed platforms to close the gap to real-world systems.
% }

%  In particular, I am focused on \textit{Cyber-Physical Swarms} (CPS), 
%  a broad term that refers to a ``swarm" (like whom
%  existing in nature) of computational (simple) entities in which different goals are 
%  achieved collectively.
%  %through a \rev{global/system-wide behavioural specification}
% %
% Engineers working in this field have to deal with distributed control, 
%  huge nodes count, and highly stochastic environments.

% So in literature, different solutions aim at handling this complexity.
%  Among the many, \textit{Aggregate Computing}~\cite{aggregatecomputing} is one of the most
%  prominent approaches to ``program" collective behaviour for such kinds of systems.
%
\rev{
In my research project, I deal with Cyber-Physical Swarm (CPS), 
 which are highly complex systems -- conceptually inspired by natural swarms -- 
 where a hoard of (simple) entities reach collective goals through self-organising behaviours.
%
Swarm robotics, ``swarms" of people (crowd) or, in general, ``swarms" of IoT devices are clearly defined applications of CPS.

These systems exist in stochastic environments and they have no fixed size (possibly very large).
%
Futhermore they are composed of entities that have partial observability of the system, 
 and that influence the environment to which they belong.
 %
Moreover, these systems are collocated in the modern IT scenario, and so we have to cope with complex and layered networks.

Nowadays, researchers are trying to handle these properties by working on the construction of robust self-adaptive collective behaviour -- 
 like the one observed in a natural environment, and so failure-resistant, efficient, and effective. 
%
For years, the behaviours synthesis has been guided by natural phenomena observation that was then transposed into computer systems --- a so-called bottom-up approach. 
 However, this trend led to specific solutions that hardly scale up with application complexity.

So my research goal is to engineer CPS, 
 namely, find a systematic methodology to synthesise and deploy self-organising behaviours. 
 It is a broad-spectrum goal and it concerns the improvement of both foundational aspects of the current state-of-the-art paradigms, 
 and the infrastructural level to apply research results into concrete systems. 
 Finally, for us, Machine Learning acts as an adjunct between these levels to push toward robust systems that can adapt to unforeseen situations.

About the state-of-the-art paradigms,} \textit{Aggregate Computing}~\cite{aggregatecomputing} is one of the most prominent approaches to ``program" such kinds of systems.
%
Indeed it enables the definition of self-organising collective behaviour 
 through manipulation of a distributed data structure called \textit{computational field}.
%
 In this way, the program specification is ``collectively" declared, \rev{abstracting over underlying aspects -- 
 such as network topology or communication protocol -- 
 and making it applicable to any system size.}
 %and so, theoretically, can scale up to any system size.
%
Aggregate Computing is proposed in various scenarios, 
 such as \rev{crowds of people, smart cities, and large-scale IoT~\cite{processes}.}

 \rev{
In my research project, we would like to extend 
 Aggregate Computing in the field of CPSs.
%  The latter can be characterised as a modern version of the notion of a swarm,
%  including a not  only swarm  of  robots  and  drones,
%  but  also  ``swarms"  of  IoT devices and ``swarms" of
%  people with wearable devices in a real environment. 
To move towards this direction, distributed intelligence, flexible middlewares, and ad-hoc
 building blocks need to be conceived, widening Aggregate Computing both
 at the foundational level and at the ``architectural" level.
}

\section{Activities}
In order to explore the foundational level, in this first year, 
 my activities have been centred on the integration of Aggregate Computing 
 with Machine Learning capability 
 to create even more intelligent collective behaviour.
%
Indeed, even if Aggregate Computing is already applied in various scenarios,
 the behaviour specification can lead to
 a complex fine-tuning sometimes led by domain experience.
%
Furthermore, some behaviours work properly only in specific contexts and when environmental
 changes happen the behaviour became unstable.
%
Definitively we think that the exploitation of 
 learning can lead to more complete collective behaviours, 
 improving our current state-of-the-art solutions, making Aggregate 
 Computing more and more applicable in real large scale systems
 and \rev{helping the automatic synthesis of self-organising behaviours.}

In the first part of my work, I tried to understand what 
 kind of machine learning algorithms is most suitable for Aggregate Computing.
%
\rev{My work climaxes} with \textit{\citetitle{research}} where I explain different suitable approaches
 to enhance Aggregate Computing with Machine learning.
%
Finally, in the last period, I made concrete experiments with 
 Reinforcement Learning -- in particular Q-Learning~\cite{watkins1992q} -- 
 improving the current Aggregate Computing solutions. 
 These works are not described in a publication yet, but we plan to organise them in a paper in a 
 few months.

Aside from ``Machine Learning'' integration, in \textit{\citetitle{collectiveautonomy}} 
 we explore the relationship between Aggregate Computing and agents autonomy. In particular, 
 we investigate the position of Aggregate Computing w.r.t individual autonomy and the collective autonomy describing how we can selectively ``adjust" it. 

\rev{Concerning} the ``architectural" level, my research activities aim at closing the \rev{gap} between
 its abstract space and its application in concrete systems. 
%
In this direction, I made mainly contributions 
 to ScaFi~\cite{scafi}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/scafi/scafi}}, 
 a research-oriented tool-chain that brings Aggregate Computing into the Scala world.
 The works consist in:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{\citetitle{scafiweb}}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/scafi/scafi-web}}: 
	A playground to experiment with Aggregate Computing. 
	From a long-term perspective, this tool should be used to support our vision of ``hybrid" systems,
	where a part of the ensemble is composed of simulated entities. 
	Furthermore, ScaFi-web should be used in support of the distributed monitoring for Aggregate Computing applications.
  \item \textit{\citetitle{scafiloci}}: 
	An approach for deploying aggregate programs in different networks topologies. 
	This work has a long-term vision of separating functional aspects from non-functional aspects.
